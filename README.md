# FewPinsPairDemos

There are 2 demo applications. One for WinForms and other one for Console. The apps show how to pair with the single Bluetooth enabled device using few PINs (in case if you do not know which PIN is correct). This application is a demo for [Bluetooth Framework](https://www.btframework.com/bluetoothframework.htm)

The demo uses fixed device's MAC so before run it with your device(s) change this in source code.
